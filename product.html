            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>The term “rucksack” – or “ruck” – is borrowed from German and literally translates to “back bag.” 
</strong></p><p><strong>Rucking seems like an easy concept: just throw a weighted bag on your back and take off down
</strong></p><p><strong>the road. But ruck marching differs from both walking and running in important ways. The
</strong></p><p><strong>added weight of the rucksack means rucking places significantly more stress on your body
</strong></p><p><strong>than simply walking or even running. And the difference in gaits or strides between walking and running means muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints are stressed in distinct ways. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>How To Do It
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>1. Choose your load
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>A good place to start for general fitness is to use a weight that’s equal to about 10 percent of your total bodyweight. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, load your pack with about 15 pounds. Don’t stress too much about going above or below by a pound or two—just stay in the general ballpark.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Once you’re comfortable, you can progress safely up to 35 pounds but no more than that. Carrying too much weight above 35 pounds, for an average person, can break down your body.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2. Load the pack
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>For weight, you could throw a dumbbell in your pack. Or you can even use a couple of bricks or a sand bag. If you feel like getting fancy, various online sites offer weight plates specifically designed for rucking. But remember that one of the reasons for rocking is to stay in shape without spending too much. Wrapping a towel or bubble wrap around your weight will help to stabilize it, so it doesn’t shift around in the bag.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>You can use any backpack you have lying around, but if you plan on using 35 pounds regularly, invest in a pack designed to hump serious weight. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3. Ruck!
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Now, toss on your pack and go for a walk or hike. You can go as long and far as you want. But when you’re just starting, it’s best to ease into the activity.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>“Afterwards, you’ll probably be sore in some places your normal fitness routine has ignored,” “Expect the muscles around your knees, your butt, and your low back to be tender. The upside is that the pack puts you into appropriate posture, so you’re working muscles that need working.”
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>What’s nice about rucking is that since it’s relatively low impact, you could do it every day if you wanted.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you’re just starting out, begin with a 30-minute ruck. That’s probably a walk or two around the neighborhood block. Slowly build up to an hour or more.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The Benefits of Rucking
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>While rucking will feel fairly easy while you’re doing it, don’t be deceived. Taking a stroll with a weighted backpack imparts a lot of benefits to body, mind, and spirit:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Rucking Helps Your Heart
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Rucking elevates your heart rate compared to regular walking (so it counts as cardio!) and has an effect on your ticker that’s comparable to jogging. Rucking also improves your all-around work capacity and endurance. Gaining the ability to cover ground under load builds a strong foundation of fitness.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Rucking Burns More Calories Than Walking and Only a Little Less Than Running
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you hate to run, but still want to get the caloric burn that comes with running, rucking is the answer you’ve been looking for. In fact, you can burn about as many calories rucking as jogging.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you’re a 200-lb man and run for an hour at 5 MPH (that’s about a 12:00 mile pace), you’ll burn 755 calories.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Walking briskly (3.5 mph) for an hour burns 391 calories for a man of the same size.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Add a weight to your brisk hour-long walk (i.e., go rucking), and the research shows you can burn around 40-50% more calories. So our 200-lb man walking at a 3.5 mph pace while carrying 50 lbs of weight will burn around 585 calories. Not too far off from running, and you didn’t have to run! It’s a win-win!
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you’re already taking regular walks, start throwing a pack on when you do; you’ll burn thousands more calories over the course of the year.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Rucking Is Less Stressful on the Body Than Running
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Part of the reason many people hate running is the stress it puts on your body, especially your knees. When you run, every stride you take can put between seven and twelve times your bodyweight onto your knees. That’s a lot of force. And if your stride is off or if you have flat feet, the repeated high impact of running can result in knee and joint pain. In fact, the stress that running puts on the joints gives long-distance running a fairly high injury rate — anywhere from 20 to 70 percent according to the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>With rucking, you’re just putting two to three times your bodyweight onto your knees with each step, plus whatever weight is on your back. It’s much less taxing on your body.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The reduced stress on the joints and tendons is the big draw with rucking, especially as one gets older. So to get the aerobic conditioning that comes from running without the stress that running puts on the body, just ruck. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Rucking Builds Strength
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Just as the legendary ancient wrestler Milo of Croton got stronger by carrying a bull on his shoulders, you’ll get stronger from carrying a weighted ruck. The added weight on your back gives the lower body a good workout. Where one really gets a strength workout from rucking is on the upper body. Even the core gets worked from rucking, as it activates to stabilize the weight.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Rucking Improves Posture
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you’ve developed Quasimodo shoulders thanks to hours of slumping at a desk each day, rucking is the perfect antidote. The weight of the backpack actually pulls the shoulders and back into proper alignment and puts you into proper posture. As you ruck more and more, you’ll be training the body to stay in that optimal position even when you’re not rucking.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Rucking Gets You Outside 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you want to increase your overall health and wellbeing, you need to up your dose of “Vitamin N” by spending time in nature. Studies have shown that spending time outdoors can decrease stress, ward off depression, reduce obesity, boost the immune system, and enhance cognitive abilities. You can compound the health benefits of being in nature by turning your wilderness jaunts into a ruck.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Rucking Gets You Social
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Humans are social animals. We get sad and depressed when we’re lonely. Even if you’re an introvert, you need a bit of social connection to stave off the funk that comes from excessive isolation.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Research has shown that one of the best ways to quickly get people feeling connected is to have them move in unison together either through dance or exercise. But here’s the thing with most exercising — it’s not all that conducive to socialization. Yeah, you can run in a group, but you usually end up running alone together. Either your running partners are faster or slower than you or it’s hard to have a good conversation because you’re huffing and puffing so much.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>With rucking, you get the bonding benefit of moving together in a group, along with the ability to talk without gasping. Even if you don’t have any friends, rucking is a great way to make some.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;
</strong></p><p><strong>Rucking Prepares You for an Emergency
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>So you’ve put together a bug-out bag and/or a get-home bag. But if stuff really hit the fan, would you be able to carry that bag for miles and miles as you try to get the hell out of dodge?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The ability to march under weights is a highly functional physical ability and a necessary survival skill. Theodore Roosevelt and JFK thought every man should be able to walk 50 miles in 20 hours — and it’s even more worthy to be able to do such while carrying a pack. Even if you never have to go quite that far, regular rucking prepares you to stay mobile in an emergency.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>So, what are you waiting for? Let’s Ruck!
